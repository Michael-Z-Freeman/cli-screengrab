cli-screengrab
==============

Windows command line screen grab utility. The screen grab does not have to be based on what is on the current monitor as the utility saves a bitmap based on given Window name. This is useful for full screen windows created by browser video players. 

cli-screengrab was developed in Linux using MinGW-w64, but should compile in Windows with minimal modification.

Please note that initial commit needs some tidying up but should compile. I have included a Code Blocks build file.
