cli-screengrab
==============

Windows command line screen grab utility. The screen grab does not have to be based on what is on the current monitor as the utility saves a bitmap based on given Window name. This is useful for full screen windows created by browser video players. 

Please note that my initial git init has included some things that need tidying up like the "Hello World" file names.
